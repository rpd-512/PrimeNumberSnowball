A snowball prime number is a beautiful series of numbers that go like:
* 2 is a prime number
* 23 is a prime number
* 239 is a prime number
* 2399 is a prime number and so on

I found it interesting and decided to build a code, because I can :D

## Usage
* To find snowballs of a specific number, use:
`python3 main.py <number>`

* To find the biggest snowball possible, use:
`python3 main.py`
